# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## Goal

The objective was to create a beautiful frontend design for a custom BMI Calculator App using custom created Widgets and Buttons from scratch (using RawMaterialButton).

## Finished App

The finished app is a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by a beautiful UI design created by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It is a multi-screen app that also features a custom Splash Screen and simple, yet fully customized UI.
